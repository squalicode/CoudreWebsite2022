                    Coudre took part in the exhibition <i>On Flower Power. The Role of the Vase in Arts, Crafts and Design</i>, curated by Martí Guixé and Inga Knölke for the <a href="https://lagallerianazionale.com/" target="_blank">Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea</a> of Rome. This first series of post-digital vases is the conclusion of several years of texture printing research.
