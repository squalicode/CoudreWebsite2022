        <p>
            Every single piece Coudre produces is a unique part, the product of a singular code and a specific formulation, finished by hand, in the crafts fashion.

            Coudre is a Barcelona based research studio delving into the intersections of digital design and the morphogenic contingencies of materials. Coudre develops software, hardware and material recipes to produce material outcomes where different agencies negociate.
