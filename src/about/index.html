        <h2>Coudre</h2>

        <p>
            Coudre is a post-digital crafts studio designing and manufacturing unique, non-serialized pieces. Using our own hand-made 3D printers, different paste formulations are extruded according to complex hand-crafted machine paths. The resulting shapes are the interaction of digital toolpaths, matter agency and serendipity.
        </p>

        <h2>Studio</h2>
        <p>
            The studio was founded by three young creatives delving into the intersections of ancient traditions & innovation, analogic & digital, and sensitive matter & technology. Coudre was born and is based in Poblenou, a vibrant neighbourhood in Barcelona.
        </p>
