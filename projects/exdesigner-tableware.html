                    Martí Guixé's <a href="https://www.ex-designer.com/" target="_blank">Ex-Designer</a> is a bar where customers can have a beer with tapas while watching the printers build up the tiles, chairs and utensils that make up the space itself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a bar where the end goal is to have every object be 3D-printed, tableware posed a challenge. Although food-grade, the PLA plastic usually used in 3D-printing degrades, leaks and breaks easily after a few uses, as well as being difficult to wash. 3D-printed ceramic tableware, made of stoneware and glazed for a non-porous finish, allows for the robustness and ease of use of traditional ceramics while fitting into the Ex-Designer's concept.
